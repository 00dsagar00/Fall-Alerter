# Fall-Alerter
A real-time Fall Detection Alert System 

# Overview
This project presents a real-time fall detection system using **deep learning** and **computer vision** 
techniques. Leveraging the **YOLOv8** object detection model, **OpenCV,** and other **Python 
libraries**, the system processes video input to accurately identify human falls based on body 
posture, movement, and position. When a fall is detected, it not only provides a visual alert but 
also triggers an **automated email notification** to alert caregivers or emergency contacts. The 
inclusion of a cooldown mechanism ensures that multiple alerts are not sent for the same 
incident. Designed for robustness and real-time performance, this system effectively minimizes 
false positives and offers a practical solution for elderly safety monitoring.
